Welcome to Gatsby! We’re glad you’re here. The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through setting up and deploying your first Gatsby site u얼ing a starter template. As we walk through that process, we’ll introduce some more general web development topics, and go over the underlying structure of a Gatsby site.
개츠비에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 찾아주시니 기쁘군요. 시작 템플릿을 사용하여 첫 번째 Gatsby 사이트를 설정하고 배포하는 것이 이 튜토리얼의 목표입니다. 그 과정을 진행하면서 몇몇 일반적인 웹 개발 주제를 소개하고 Gatsby 사이트의 기본 구조에 대해서 살펴보도록 하겠습니다.

> The full tutorial is intended to be as accessible as possible to people without much web development experience (yet!) — no need to be an expert. If you prefer to jump straight to code, feel free to skip the step-by-step tutorial and see the [quick start](/docs/quick-start/) page.
> 전체 튜토리얼은 웹 개발 경험이 (아직) 많지 않은 사람도 가능한 한 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 만들어졌습니다. 만약 코드로 바로 뛰어들고 싶으시면 단계별 튜토리얼을 건너뛰고 [빠른 시작](/docs/quick-start/) 페이지를 보세요.

## Theme tutorials

Gatsby themes abstract all of your default configuration (shared functionality, data sourcing, design) out of your site and into an installable package.

This means that the configuration and functionality isn’t directly written into your project, but rather versioned, centrally managed, and installed as a dependency. You can seamlessly update a theme, compose themes together, and even swap out one compatible theme for another.

Learn more about using and building themes with the [Gatsby theme tutorials](/tutorial/theme-tutorials/).

## Additional tutorials

There are many use cases for Gatsby, some of which aren't covered in the first set of tutorials to keep you focused while learning. Gatsby's Additional Tutorials section is a collection of resources showing how to complete even more Gatsby tasks step-by-step, such as using source plugins for images and CMS content.
